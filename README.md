#Electron Sketcher

Tiny [electron](https://www.electronjs.org)-powered boilerplate to help do creative stuff and tools with [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) and use it as desktop app.

Code structure is pretty simple:

`index.js` contains basic electron logic.
`sketch.js` is intended for sketching.

Clone repo and have fun!
